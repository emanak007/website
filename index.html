 <font size="6"> Scratch is a block-based programming language designed to be easy to use. Scratch is designed for those who are between 
     the age of 8 to 16 years old, but anyone can use it. Scratch is often used as a beginning language, to teach them code. 
     You can make simple things but as you get used to scratch you can create more complex projects. </font size>
